# Architecture & Core Design

## 1. System Overview
Remoat runs entirely on the user's local PC with no external server. It communicates with Telegram's Bot API over HTTPS and controls Antigravity via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

    end
```

## 2. Authentication & Security
No port forwarding or webhooks required — the bot polls Telegram's API.

- **Token & Credential Management:**
  - Uses `dotenv` to load secrets from a local `.env` file. Recommend strict file permissions (e.g. `chmod 600`).
  - Only `.env.example` is committed to source control.
- **Authorization:**
  - Every incoming message and callback query is checked against the `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` whitelist before any processing.
- **Input Validation & Path Traversal Protection:**
  - All workspace path operations are resolved against `WORKSPACE_BASE_DIR` using `path.resolve` to prevent directory traversal attacks.

## 3. Project Management (Topic ↔ Project, Session ↔ Chat)
Telegram **Forum Topics = Projects**, **Sessions within topics = Chat Sessions**.

### Implemented Features
- **`/project`**: Lists subdirectories under the workspace base as inline keyboard buttons. Selecting one auto-creates a forum topic + initial session.
- **`/new`**: Starts a new Antigravity chat session within the current project topic.
- **`/chat`**: Shows the current session info and lists all sessions in the project.
- **Auto-rename**: On first message, the session topic is renamed based on the prompt content (e.g. `session-1` → `1-react-auth-bug-fix`).

### Data Flow
1. User sends `/project` → inline keyboard with project list
2. `TelegramTopicManager.ensureTopic()` creates a forum topic, `WorkspaceBindingRepository` persists topic_id ↔ workspace_path
3. `ChatSessionRepository` persists session metadata (topic ID, session number, rename state)
4. `/new` → new session in same topic + new Antigravity chat
5. First message → `TitleGeneratorService` generates title → topic renamed

### Architecture
```
src/database/workspaceBindingRepository.ts  — SQLite CRUD (workspace_bindings table)
src/database/chatSessionRepository.ts       — SQLite CRUD (chat_sessions table)
src/services/workspaceService.ts            — FS operations & path validation (scanWorkspaces, validatePath)
src/services/telegramTopicManager.ts        — Telegram Forum Topic management (ensureTopic, closeTopic)
src/services/titleGeneratorService.ts       — Topic name auto-generation (CDP + text extraction fallback)
src/services/chatSessionService.ts          — Antigravity UI operations (new chat via CDP, session info)
src/commands/workspaceCommandHandler.ts     — /project command + inline keyboard handling
src/commands/chatCommandHandler.ts          — /new, /chat commands
```

### Future Extensions
- Direct workspace switching in Antigravity via CDP (currently uses prompt prefix)
- LLM API-based title generation (currently text extraction based)

## 4. Context Preservation
Instructions and results are linked through Telegram's reply chain and SQLite state.

- **Metadata in SQLite:** Message IDs and workspace context are stored in SQLite, allowing reply-based follow-up to restore the full project context.
- **Reply-based continuation:** When a user replies to a bot message, Remoat loads the associated workspace/session context and forwards the follow-up to Antigravity.

## 5. Scheduled Tasks
- Backend implementation using `node-cron` with `ScheduleService` and `ScheduleRepository`.
- SQLite persists schedule definitions (`id`, `cron_expression`, `prompt`, `workspace_id`, `status`).
- On startup, schedules are reloaded from SQLite into in-memory cron jobs.
- Telegram `/schedule` command integration is planned.

## 6. Real-Time Progress Updates
- Remoat monitors Antigravity's output via CDP DOM polling.
- Throttled message sending (every 3-5 seconds) avoids Telegram API rate limits.
- Progress is sent as `<pre>` code blocks; final output uses full HTML formatting.

> **Details:** See [RESPONSE_MONITOR.md](./RESPONSE_MONITOR.md) for CDP-based response monitoring and process log extraction.

## 7. Antigravity Process Launch (CLI Spawn) & Resource Control
- **CLI Spawn:** Antigravity is launched as an independent background process via `child_process.spawn`.
- **Task Queue:** Concurrent task limits (per-workspace and global) prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Kill Switch:** Process PIDs are tracked; `/stop` force-kills the process tree.
- **Message Chunking:** Output exceeding Telegram's 4096-character limit is automatically split into multiple messages.
